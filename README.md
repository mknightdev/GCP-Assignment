## About
<p>In this assignment, there was a choice to develop a demo demonstrating shadows, ray tracing, or physically based rendering (PBR). I decided on the latter and created a demo with six spheres and four lights.<p>
<p>This demo used the <a href="https://github.com/mknightdev/myengine" target="_blank">engine</a> I created for another assignment, so the focus was purely on implementing PBR.</p>

## PBR Techniques

<p>The demo uses GGX/Schlick-GGX (left) and Blinn-Phong/Geometry Beckmann (right) techniques to demonstrate my understanding of PBR.</p>

<p>Top level architecture of the demo. As mentioned above, this demo uses the <a href="https://github.com/mknightdev/myengine" target="_blank">engine</a> I created meaning I already had entities, components, rendering, etc. to demonstrate PBR.
